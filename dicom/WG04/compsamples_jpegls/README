This set consists of a collection of medical images in both
uncompressed form, and compressed with various lossless
and lossy compression schemes defined by the DICOM standard.

These include JPEG lossless (JPLL) and lossy (JPLY), JPEG-LS in
lossless (JLSL) and near-lossless modes (JLSN), and JPEG 2000
reversible (J2KR) and irreversible (J2KI).

Not all the images have been compressed using all schemes and
modes; in particular the color images have been compressed using
JPEG 2000 only, and since the JPEG lossy process only supports
12 bit unsigned images, those images with an actual dynamic range
outside that range have not been JPEG lossy compressed.

No effort has been made to align the target bit-rates (compression
ratios) of the various lossy compressors, since the objective
is to provide sample images to test and demonstrate implementation,
not to compare the efficacy of one scheme with another. While one
can obviously compare the effectiveness of lossless compression
by looking at the file sizes, the small number of images and diversity
of modalities used make such a comparison fairly meaningless. For
interest, the file sizes are as follows:

The compressed images are encapsulated as per the standard
requirements in PS 3.5; even though all the images are single
frame in some cases the compressed bitstream is fragmented
into multiple items.

The codecs used were:

- for JPEG, the Stanford PVRG codec
- for JPEG-LS, the dicom3tools rawnjl2 codec
- for JPEG 2000, the Kakadu codec

The following images are contained in the set, as described
by the accompanying DICOMDIR:

The set of uncompressed images are those that were originally
supplied to ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 for the purpose of informally
evaluating the effect of proposed JPEG 2000 schemes on image
quality. An updated version of the original description of
the images supplied to JTC1/SC29/WG1 follows ...

The images contain no patient identifying information.

They were initially obtained from various publically available
collections of images, including NEMA DICOM demonstrations
and public web servers, as well as some images specifically
solicited for the purpose of testing compression. The original
sources were:

- CT1,MR3,NM1,US1,XA1: GE
- CT2,MR1: Toshiba
- MR2,MR4,RG1: Philips
- RG2,RG3: Fuji
- MG1: USF (http://marathon.csee.usf.edu/Mammography/Database.html)
- SC1: Cemax (now Kodak)
- VL1,VL2,VL3: ASGE
- VL4: AAO (Hildebrand)
- VL5,VL6: CAP (Balis)

They are intended to be a representative set of the broad
range of different types of medical images. They may not
necessarily be particularly challenging or unusual and may not
contain any particularly subtle abnormalities, so should
not be assumed to be critical tests of a compression
scheme nor imply any likely usefulness from a diagnostic
point of view. The decision to use a lossy compression
scheme for medical applications may require a more rigorous
observer-performance study of a carefully selected set to
test a particular diagnostic task.

The uncompressed images are "dual-personality" in the sense that
they are both DICOM and TIFF images.

Images are all encoded as standard DICOM Image Storage SOP Classes;
the Visible Light and Mammography images are stored as Secondary Capture,
since more specific SOP Classes were not defined at the time that
these images were originally created.

Non-medical users may find it more convenient to extract
the pixel data from the images using a conventional TIFF
reader, rather than a DICOM reader. Be aware that some of
the images, including the CT and some of the MR images,
contained signed data, and hence will "look strange". It
is expected that the results of the compress/decompress
cycle will result in data of the same form as the original
and will be evaluated visually using medical software
that "knows" about signed data, ie. don't try to fix
what these "look like" before compressing them !

Note that Bits is the official number of bits used as
stated by the source of the images ... the dynamic
range of the actual image may not use this much.

Also, the images are stored as 8 or 16 bit words (little
endian), eg. a 12 bit pixel actually occupies 16 bits (in
the least significant bits). This is all described in the
DICOM header, but the TIFF header doesn't preserve this
distinction.

All images are single frame. The color image(s) are all
color-by pixel (ie. RGBRGB...), not color-by-plane.
